# Updated: Samsung Slash – Space Theme Background

## Change
Update the game's background from the Samsung-branded dark/blue gradient to a **spacey theme** with:

- Deep dark space gradient background (dark navy/black)
- Animated twinkling stars scattered across the screen
- Subtle light rays / nebula-like glow effects radiating from the center or edges
- Stars and rays present on all screens (Start, Gameplay, Game Over)

This gives the game an immersive, cosmic feel while Samsung products fly through space to be sliced.

## All Other Features Remain the Same
- Start Screen with "Samsung Slash" title, START button, high score
- Gameplay with 4 Samsung products, swipe slicing, pixel explosions, blade trail
- 3 lives, Fruit Ninja scoring with combos
- Progressive difficulty
- Game Over screen with score and replay
- Mobile-first touch controls
- Canvas-based rendering
